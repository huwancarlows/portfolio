                I’m a BSIT graduate and aspiring full-stack developer passionate about creating practical, efficient, and well-designed applications. My experience includes working with Laravel, Next.js, React, Supabase, MySQL, REST APIs, C#, and Tailwind CSS.

I love building systems that automate workflows—such as fleet management tools, reporting systems, dashboards, Excel import modules, and authentication setups. I enjoy digging into problems, understanding how things work, and turning challenges into clean, maintainable solutions.

I’m always learning, always improving, and always excited to build something new.
